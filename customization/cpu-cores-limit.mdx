## Overview

Compresto allows you to limit the number of CPU cores used during compression. This setting helps balance compression performance with system responsiveness.

## Available Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **2 cores** | Minimal CPU usage, keeps system highly responsive |
| **4 cores** | Balanced CPU usage |
| **Max** | Uses all available cores for fastest compression (default) |

## When to Use

Limiting CPU cores can improve system performance during compression by:

- Keeping your Mac responsive while compressing large files
- Allowing you to continue working on other tasks during compression
- Reducing system heat and fan noise on intensive compression jobs

## How to Configure

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Open Compresto
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Go to **Settings** > **Advanced**
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Adjust the **CPU cores for compression** slider

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Using fewer cores will result in slower compression times, but your system will remain more responsive for other tasks.
