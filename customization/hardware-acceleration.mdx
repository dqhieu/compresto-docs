## Overview

Hardware acceleration uses your Mac's GPU to speed up video encoding and decoding. When enabled, Compresto leverages Apple's VideoToolbox framework to significantly reduce compression time.

## Benefits

- **Faster compression**: GPU encoding is typically 2-5x faster than CPU-only encoding
- **Lower CPU usage**: Frees up your CPU for other tasks during compression
- **Reduced heat**: Less CPU load means less heat generation

## How It Works

When enabled, Compresto automatically detects available hardware acceleration capabilities on your Mac and uses them for video processing. This works with:

- Apple Silicon Macs (M1, M2, M3, M4 series)
- Intel Macs with integrated or discrete GPUs

## How to Configure

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Open Compresto
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Go to **Settings** > **Advanced**
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Toggle **Automatic hardware acceleration** on or off

  </Step>
</Steps>

## When to Disable

In most cases, hardware acceleration should be left enabled. However, you might want to disable it if:

- You experience video quality issues with specific files
- You encounter compatibility problems with certain video formats
- You prefer maximum quality over speed (software encoding can sometimes produce slightly better quality at the same bitrate)

<Note>
Hardware acceleration is enabled by default. Most users should leave this setting on for the best performance.
