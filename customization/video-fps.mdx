## Overview

Compresto allows you to set a target frame rate (FPS) for video compression. Reducing the frame rate can significantly decrease file size while maintaining acceptable visual quality for certain types of content.

## Available Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Same as input** | Keep the original frame rate (default) |
| **60** | High frame rate for smooth motion |
| **30** | Standard frame rate for web and social media |
| **24** | Cinematic frame rate, smaller file size |
| **15** | Low frame rate for maximum compression |

## How It Works

The target FPS setting only **reduces** frame rate - it never increases it. If your input video has a lower frame rate than the target, the original frame rate is preserved.

For example:
- Input: 60 fps, Target: 30 fps → Output: 30 fps
- Input: 24 fps, Target: 30 fps → Output: 24 fps (unchanged)

## When to Use Each Option

### Same as input
Best for preserving original quality when file size isn't a concern.

### 60 fps
- Gaming videos
- Sports footage
- High-motion content

### 30 fps
- General web content
- Social media videos
- Screen recordings

### 24 fps
- Film-like aesthetic
- Cinematic content
- Good balance of quality and file size

### 15 fps
- Simple animations
- Slideshows with minimal motion
- Maximum file size reduction

<Note>
Lowering frame rate reduces file size but may make motion appear less smooth. Use lower frame rates only when the content doesn't require high motion fidelity.
