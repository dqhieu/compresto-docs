## Overview

Compresto allows you to choose the video encoding codec used during compression. The codec affects the compression efficiency, file size, and compatibility of your output videos.

## Available Codecs

| Codec | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **H.264 (Recommended)** | Widely compatible codec supported by virtually all devices and platforms |
| **H.265/HEVC** | Newer codec with better compression efficiency but limited compatibility |

## Comparison

### H.264

- **Compatibility**: Excellent - works on almost all devices, browsers, and platforms
- **Compression**: Good compression with reliable quality
- **Processing speed**: Generally faster encoding
- **Best for**: General use, sharing online, maximum compatibility

### H.265/HEVC

- **Compatibility**: Limited - may not work on older devices or some browsers
- **Compression**: Better compression (smaller files at same quality)
- **Processing speed**: Slower encoding
- **Best for**: Archiving, when file size is critical, newer Apple devices
