## Overview

AI renaming uses OpenAI's vision API to analyze your compressed images and generate descriptive file names automatically. Instead of keeping generic names like `IMG_0042.jpg`, Compresto can rename files based on their visual content — e.g., `sunset-over-mountain-lake.jpg`.

<Note>
AI renaming is currently available for **images only**. Video, GIF, and PDF files are not supported yet.

## Setup

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Open **Settings** > **AI Renaming**
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Enter your **OpenAI API key**

    You can get an API key from [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Choose your preferred **AI model**
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Select a **naming preset** or create a custom prompt
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Enable **AI Renaming** and compress your images — files will be renamed automatically
  </Step>
</Steps>

## AI Models

| Model | Speed | Cost | Best For |
|-------|-------|------|----------|
| **GPT-5 Nano** | Fastest | Lowest | Quick batch renaming |
| **GPT-5 Mini** | Fast | Low | Everyday use |
| **GPT-5** | Moderate | Medium | Detailed descriptions |
| **GPT-5.1** | Slower | Higher | High accuracy |
| **GPT-5.2** | Slowest | Highest | Maximum accuracy |

<Note>
Faster models cost less per image but may produce less detailed names. For most users, **GPT-5 Mini** offers the best balance of speed and quality.

## Naming Presets

| Preset | Example Output | Description |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| **Descriptive** | `golden-retriever-playing-in-park` | Detailed description of the image content |
| **SEO Friendly** | `cute-dog-park-outdoor-photography` | Optimized for search engines with relevant keywords |
| **Short** | `dog-park` | Brief, concise file names |
| **Technical** | `canine-outdoor-natural-lighting-wide-angle` | Technical photography terminology |
| **Custom** | *(your prompt)* | Define your own naming rules |

### Custom Prompt

When using the **Custom** preset, you can write your own prompt to control how files are named. For example:

- `"Name the file based on the dominant color and subject"`
- `"Use product category followed by a brief description"`
- `"Generate a name suitable for an e-commerce product listing"`

## Max Filename Length

Set a maximum character limit for generated file names to keep them manageable. This prevents overly long names that can cause issues with some file systems or workflows.

## Tips

- **Batch processing**: AI renaming works with batch compression — all images in a batch are renamed individually
- **API costs**: Each image requires one API call. Monitor your OpenAI usage for large batches
- **Custom prompts**: Be specific in custom prompts for more consistent results
- **File extension**: The original file extension is always preserved regardless of the generated name
