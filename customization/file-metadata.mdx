## Overview

By default, Compresto strips metadata from files during compression to achieve smaller file sizes. However, you can choose to preserve various types of metadata when needed.

## Available Options

### Retain Image Metadata (EXIF, IPTC)

Preserves camera and photo information embedded in your images.

**EXIF data includes:**
- Camera make and model
- Date and time the photo was taken
- Exposure settings (aperture, shutter speed, ISO)
- GPS location (if available)
- Lens information

**IPTC data includes:**
- Copyright information
- Author/creator details
- Keywords and captions
- Location descriptions

<Warning>
Enabling this option may increase output file size.
</Warning>

### Preserve Color Profile (ICC)

Maintains the original color space of your images. This is important for:

- Professional photography workflows
- Print production
- Color-accurate displays
- Images with specific color gamuts (Adobe RGB, ProPhoto RGB, Display P3)

<Note>
Preserving color profiles may slightly increase file size but ensures colors display correctly across different devices.
</Note>

### Retain Creation Date

Keeps the original file creation date on the compressed output. Without this option, compressed files will have the current date as their creation date.

Useful for:
- Maintaining photo library organization
- Preserving chronological order in file managers
- Archival purposes

## How to Configure

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Open Compresto
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Go to **Settings** > **Advanced**
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Toggle the metadata options you want to preserve:
    - **Retain image metadata (EXIF, IPTC)**
    - **Preserve color profile (ICC)**
    - **Retain creation date**

    ![file metadata](/images/file_metadata.png)
  </Step>
</Steps>

## When to Use

| Scenario | Recommended Settings |
|----------|---------------------|
