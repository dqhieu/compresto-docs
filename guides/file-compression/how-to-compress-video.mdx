## Compression Options

### Video Quality

|---------|-------------|----------|
| **Highest** | Maximum quality, larger files | Archiving, professional use |
| **High** | Excellent quality (default) | General use |
| **Good** | Good balance of quality and size | Sharing online |
| **Medium** | Moderate compression | Social media |

<Note>

</Note>

### Video Resolution

| Resolution | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Same as input** | Keep original resolution (default) |
| **4K (2160p)** | 3840 x 2160 pixels |
| **Full HD (1080p)** | 1920 x 1080 pixels |
| **HD (720p)** | 1280 x 720 pixels |

### Video Format

| Format | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Same as input** | Keep original format (default) |
| **MP4** | Most compatible format, works everywhere |
| **WebM** | Optimized for web, smaller file sizes |
| **MOV** | Apple's format, good for macOS/iOS |
| **GIF** | Convert video to animated GIF |

### Additional Options

#### Remove Audio

Strip the audio track from videos to reduce file size. Useful for:
- Videos where audio isn't needed
- Creating silent background videos
- Reducing file size when audio quality doesn't matter

#### Preserve Transparency

For videos with alpha channels (transparent backgrounds), enable this option to maintain transparency in the output. Available for:
- WebM format (always enabled)
- MOV format with alpha channel

<Note>
When preserving transparency, only Highest, Ultra HD, and Full HD quality options are available.
</Note>

## Converting Video to GIF

When you select GIF as the output format, additional options appear:

### FPS (Frames Per Second)

Adjust the frame rate of the GIF (10-50 fps). Lower FPS means smaller file size but choppier animation.

### GIF Quality

| Quality | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Highest** | Best quality, largest file |
| **High** | Great quality (default) |
| **Good** | Good balance |
| **Medium** | Moderate quality |
| **Acceptable** | Smallest file size |

### GIF Dimension

Resize the GIF to reduce file size. Options include various percentage reductions or specific pixel widths.

## Tips for Best Results

- **For web use**: Choose "Good" quality and MP4 format for best compatibility
- **For social media**: Use "Medium" quality with appropriate resolution for the platform
- **For archiving**: Use "Highest" quality to preserve maximum detail
- **For file size limits**: Use the "File size" option to target a specific size
- **For silent videos**: Enable "Remove audio" to save additional space
