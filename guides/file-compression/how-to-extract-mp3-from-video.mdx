## Overview

Compresto can extract the audio track from any video file and save it as a high-quality MP3. This is useful for extracting music, voiceovers, podcasts, or any audio content from video files.

## Audio Quality

Compresto uses the highest quality VBR (Variable Bit Rate) encoding via the `libmp3lame` encoder. This produces MP3 files with excellent audio fidelity while keeping file sizes efficient.

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| **Encoder** | libmp3lame |
| **Quality** | Highest VBR (V0, ~245 kbps average) |
| **Channels** | Same as source |

## Tips

- **Source audio required**: The video must contain an audio track. Videos with no audio will produce an empty or invalid file.
- **Supported inputs**: Works with any video format Compresto supports — MP4, MOV, WebM, MKV, etc.
- **File size**: The output MP3 size depends on the audio duration and complexity, not the video resolution or size.
- **Batch extraction**: You can extract audio from multiple videos at once — each will produce a separate MP3 file.
