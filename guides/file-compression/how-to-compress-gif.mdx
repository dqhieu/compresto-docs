## Compression Options

### GIF Quality

| Quality | Description | Best For |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| **Highest** | Maximum quality, larger files | High-quality animations |
| **High** | Excellent quality (default) | General use |
| **Good** | Good balance of quality and size | Web animations |
| **Medium** | Moderate compression | Social media |
| **Acceptable** | Highest compression, smallest files | Quick sharing |

### GIF Dimension

Resize GIFs to reduce file size:

| Dimension | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Same as input** | Keep original size (default) |
| **75%** | Reduce to 75% of original |
| **50%** | Reduce to half size |
| **25%** | Reduce to quarter size |

<Note>
Reducing dimensions significantly decreases file size while maintaining animation smoothness.
</Note>

## Tips for Best Results

- **For Discord/Slack**: Use "Good" quality with 50% dimension for fast loading
- **For websites**: Use "High" quality, reduce dimension if file is too large
- **For maximum reduction**: Combine "Acceptable" quality with 25% dimension
- **For quality preservation**: Use "Highest" quality and keep original dimension
