## Overview

[Ghostscript](https://www.ghostscript.com/) is required to compress PDF files in Compresto. Developed by Artifex Software, Inc., Ghostscript is a leading PDF rendering and conversion tool.

<Note>
If you have Homebrew installed, Compresto will automatically attempt to install Ghostscript when you first try to compress a PDF.
</Note>

## Quick Install (Homebrew Users)

If you have Homebrew installed, simply click the **Install Ghostscript via Homebrew** button in the app.

Compresto will run `brew install ghostscript` and automatically configure the path for you.

  <Step title="Open Settings">

## Common Paths

| Installation Method | Mac Type | Path |
|---------------------|----------|------|
| Homebrew | Apple Silicon | `/opt/homebrew/bin/gs` |
| Homebrew | Intel | `/usr/local/bin/gs` |
| MacPorts | Any | `/opt/local/bin/gs` |

## Troubleshooting

### "Ghostscript is not installed" error

This means the Ghostscript path is not configured. Follow the steps above to install and configure Ghostscript.

### Path not working

1. Open Terminal and run `which gs` to verify the correct path
2. Make sure the path ends with `/gs` (not `/ghostscript`)
3. Ensure Ghostscript was installed successfully by running `gs --version`

### Homebrew button not appearing

The **Install Ghostscript via Homebrew** button only appears if Homebrew is detected on your system. If you don't see it, install Homebrew first or use MacPorts.

## Disclaimer

Compresto does not own or distribute Ghostscript. Ghostscript is installed separately on your device and is used by Compresto solely for PDF compression.
